Exercise: Building with Elevator Component

Overview:
You are tasked with developing a front-end component that simulates a building with an elevator. The component should allow users to click on a floor and move the elevator to that floor. The component should also display the current floor of the elevator and a queue of floors that are pending.

Requirements:

The component should display a building with a specified number of floors and an elevator that can move between the floors.
The component should display the current floor of the elevator and a queue of floors that are pending.
The component should allow users to click on a floor to add it to the queue of pending floors.
The elevator should move smoothly between floors. You can use animations or other techniques to achieve this effect.
The component should have an emergency stop button. When pressed, the elevator should stop moving and all buttons should become disabled until the emergency stop button is reset.
Optional:

Add a feature that allows users to specify their destination floor before entering the elevator. This can be accomplished using a keypad or touch screen interface outside the elevator.
Add a feature that allows users to see which floor the elevator is currently on from outside the elevator. This can be accomplished using a display panel near the elevator doors.
